term editor: person:Chris Stoeckert@en
curator note: From the DT branch: This term and definition were originally submitted by the community to our branch, but we thought they best fit DENRIE. However we see several issues with this. First of all the name 'probe' might not be used in OBI. Instead we have a 'reporter' role. Also, albeit the term 'probe intensity' is often used in communities such as the microarray one, the name 'probe' is ambiguous (some use it to refer to what's on the array, some use it to refer to what's hybed to the array). Furthermore, this concept could possibly be encompassed by combining different OBI terms, such as the roles of analyte, detector and reporter (you need something hybed to a probe on the array to get an intensity) and maybe a more general term for 'measuring intensities'. We need to find the right balance between what is consistent with OBI and combinations of its terms and what is user-friendly. Finally, note that 'intensity' is already in the OBI .owl file and is also in PATO. Why didn't OBI import it from PATO? This might be a problem.@en

editor preferred term~editor preferred label: planned process
has curation status: ready for release
editor note: 'Plan' includes a future direction sense. That can be problematic if plans are changed during their execution. There are however implicit contingencies for protocols that an agent has in his mind that can be considered part of the plan, even if the agent didn't have them in mind before. Therefore, a planned process can diverge from what the agent would have said the plan was before executing it, by adjusting to problems encountered during execution (e.g. choosing another reagent with equivalent properties, if the originally planned one has run out.)
editor note: We are only considering successfully completed planned processes. A plan may be modified, and details added during execution. For a given planned process, the associated realized plan specification is the one encompassing all changes made during execution. This means that all processes in which an agent acts towards achieving some 
  objectives is a planned process.

curator note: Feb 10, 2009.  changes after discussion at OBI Consortium Workshop Feb 2-6, 2009.  accepted as core term.

  May 28 2013. Updated definition taken from ReO based on discussions initiated in Philly 2011 workshop.  Former defnition described a narrower view of reagents in chemistry that restricts bearers of the role to be chemical entities ("a role played by a molecular entity used to produce a chemical reaction to detect, measure, or produce other substances").  Updated definition allows for broader view of reagents in the domain of biomedical research to include larger materials that have parts that participate chemically in a molecular reaction or interaction.
  
comment: (copied from ReO)
  Reagents are distinguished from instruments or devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in or have parts that participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during their intended participation in some technique.  By contrast, instruments do not participate in a chemical reaction/interaction during the technique.

  Reagents are distinguished from study subjects/evaluants in that study subjects and evaluants are that about which conclusions are drawn and knowledge is sought in an investigation - while reagents, by definition, are not.  It should be noted, however, that reagent and study subject/evaluant roles can be borne by instances of the same type of material entity - but a given instance will realize only one of these roles in the execution of a given assay or technique. For example, taq polymerase can bear a reagent role or an evaluant role.  In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized. In an assay to evaluate the quality of the taq polymerase itself, the evaluant/study subject role of the taq is realized, but not the reagent role since the taq is the subject about which data is generated.

  In regard to the statement that reagents are 'distinct' from the specified outputs of a technique, note that a reagent may be incorporated into a material output of a technique, as long as the IDENTITY of this output is distinct from that of the bearer of the reagent role.  For example, dNTPs input into a PCR are reagents that become part of the material output of this technique, but this output has a new identity (ie that of a 'nucleic acid molecule') that is distinct from the identity of the dNTPs that comprise it.  Similarly, a biotin molecule input into a cell labeling technique are reagents that become part of the specified output, but the identity of the output is that of some modified cell specimen which shares identity with the input unmodified cell specimen, and not with the biotin label. Thus, we see that an important criteria of 'reagent-ness' is that it is a facilitator, and not the primary focus of an investigation or material processing technique (ie not the specified subject/evaluant about which knowledge is sought, or the specified output material of the technique).

subclass of: material entity
editor preferred term~editor preferred label: organization@en
has curation status: ready for release
editor note: BP: The definition summarizes long email discussions on the OBI developer, roles, biomaterial and denrie branches. It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:

  1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch
  editor), with individual persons as bearers

  2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)

  3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles
  there are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the
  charter/rules/bylaws themselves.

  It is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent
  continuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the
  bearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define
  organization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to
  all kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.

  Interestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place
  organization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,
  Government Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,
  W3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.

  This leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -
  3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its
  current place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to
  'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue
  for now.@en

textual definition: Relation between a process and a function, where the unfolding of the 
  process requires the execution of the function. Class level: P realizes F iff: 
  given any p that instantiates P, there exists some f, t such that f instantiates
   F at t and p *realizes* f. Here, *realizes* is the primitive 
  instance level relation [GOC:cjm]
example of usage: example of usage: The process of 'histidine catabolism' (GO:0006548) realizes the 
  function 'histidine ammonia lyase activity' (GO:0004397) (note: here 'activity' 
  denotes a function and not a process). We leave open the possibility of defining 
  in future the sub-relations directly_realizes (as bewteen a function and it's 
  functioning) and indirectly_realizes.

  chemical ionization are used for gases and vapors. In chemical
  ionization sources, the material is ionized by chemical ion-molecule
  reactions during collisions in the source. Two techniques often used
  with liquid and solid biological samples include electrospray
  ionization (due to John Fenn PMID 2675315.) and matrix-assisted laser
  desorption/ionization (MALDI, due to M. Karas and F. Hillenkamp

textual definition: The nitrogen phosphorus detector (NPD) (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive, specific detector the design of which, is based on the FID. Physically the sensor appears to be very similar to the FID but, in fact, operates on an entirely different principle. The nitrogen phosphorous detector (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive but specific detector that responds almost exclusively to nitrogen and phosphorous compounds. It is based on the flame ionization detector but differs in that it contains a rubidium or cesium silicate (glass) bead situated in a heater coil, a little distance from the hydrogen flame. If the detector is to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorous then the hydrogen flow should be minimal so that the gas does not ignite at the jet. If the detector is to respond to phosphorous only, a large flow of hydrogen is used which is burnt at the jet. The heated bead emits electrons by thermionic emission. These electrons are collected under a potential of a few volts by an appropriately placed anode, and provides a background current. When a solute containing nitrogen or phosphorous is eluted from the column, the partially combusted nitrogen and phosphorous materials are adsorbed on the surface of the bead. The adsorbed material reduces the work function of the surface and, as consequence, the emission of electrons is increased which raises the current collected at the electrode. The sensitivity of the detector to phosphorous is about 10-12 gram per ml and for nitrogen about 10-11 gram per ml at a signal to nose ratio of 2. The alkali bead as a finite life and needs regular replacement.@en

vacuum degasser
label: vacuum degasser@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: A degassing system used for degassing solvents in liquid chromatography. Dissolved gasses, usually nitrogen and oxygen from the air, tend to be evolved in the mobile phase as the pressure is reduced when the mobile phase leaves the liquid chromatography column and enters the detector. Gasses in the mobile phase in the detector can produce completely unacceptable noise and, thus, must be removed. The dissolved gasses were originally removed under vacuum but, unfortunately, are soon replaced if the solvent is left in contact with air at atmospheric pressure. For this reason degassing is now usually carried out by bubbling helium through the mobile phase reservoirs. Secondly, vacuum is used in the thermionic detector. This consists of a device, very similar in design to the thermionic valve which is attached to a vacuum and a small quantity of the eluent from a gas chromatography column allowed to bleed through it. Helium is used as the carrier gas. The presence of solute vapor causes the thermionic current to fall. This type of detector tends to become contaminated rather readily.@en

photoionization detector
label: photoionization detector@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: The selective determination of aromatic hydrocarbons or organo-heteroatom species is the job of the photoionization detector (PID). This device uses ultraviolet light as a means of ionizing an analyte exiting from a GC column. The ions produced by this process are collected by electrodes. The current generated is therefore a measure of the analyte concentration. f the amount of ionization is reproducible for a given compound, pressure, and light source then the current collected at the PID's reaction cell electrodes is reproducibly proportional to the amount of that compound entering the cell. The reason why the compounds that are routinely analyzed are either aromatic hydrocarbons or heteroatom containing compounds (like organosulfur or organophosphorus species) is because these species have ionization potentials (IP) that are within reach of commercially available UV lamps. The available lamp energies range from 8.3 to 11.7 ev, that is, lambda max ranging from 150 nm to 106 nm. Although most PIDs have only one lamp, lamps in the PID are exchanged depending on the compound selectivity required in the analysis.@en

textual definition: A flame ionization detector is a GC detector that consist of a hydrogen/air flame and a collector plate which are normally heated independently of the chromatographic oven. Heating is necessary in order to prevent condensation of water generated by the flame and also to prevent any hold-up of solutes as they pass from the column to the flame. There is an electrode above the flame to collect the ions formed at a hydrogen/air flame. The number of ions hitting the collector is measured and a signal is generated. Flame ionization detectors are most widely used and generally applicable for gas chromatography and hence is used for routine and general purpose analysis.

liquid chromatography valve
label: liquid chromatography valve@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: A sample valve that must be able to sustain pressures up to 10,000 p.s.i., although it is most likely to operate on a continuous basis, at pressures of 3,000 p.s.i. or less. The higher the operating pressure the tighter the valve seating surfaces must be forced together to eliminate any leak. It follows that any abrasive material, however fine, that passes into the valve can cause the valve seating to become scored each time it is rotated which will ultimately lead to leaks. This will cause the sample size to vary between samples and eventually affect the accuracy of the analysis. It follows that any solid material must be carefully removed from any sample before filling the valve. The sample volume of an internal loop valve is situated in the connecting slot of the valve rotor and can be used only for relatively small sample volumes. Internal sample loop valves provide samples with volumes ranging from 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml. Valve operation is shown in figure 6. The left-hand side diagram shows the load position. The sample occupies the rotor slot and has been filled by passing the sample from an appropriate syringe through the rotor slot to waste. While loading the sample, the mobile phase supply is passed through the valve directly to the column. To place the sample onto the column, the valve is then rotated and the valve slot containing the sample is now placed between the solvent supply and the column. As a result, the sample is passed into the column by the flow of solvent.@en

Bruker CryoProbe
label: Bruker CryoProbe@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: The Bruker BioSpin CryoProbe is a high-performance cryogenically cooled probe developed for high-resolution applications. It has improved signal/noise (S/N) ratios obtained by reducing the operating temperature of the coil and the pre-amplifier. As a result, the efficiency of the coil is improved and the noise of the coil and the pre-amplifier are reduced.The dramatic increase in the S/N ratio by a factor of 3-4, as compared to conventional probes, leads to a possible reduction in experiment time of up to 16 or a reduction in required sample concentration by a factor of up to 4. The CryoProbes possess key characteristics for NMR analysis:\n   Significant S/N gains (with moderately salty samples also)\n   Short pulse widths\n   Short ring down times\n   Linear behavior in power response\n   Gradient capability\n   CryoProbes are available as Triple Resonance, Dual, Selective X Detection, MicroImaging, and Quad Nucleus Probes configurations at 400 MHz and higher\n   All high resolution probes have a lock circuit\n   All high resolution probes have Z-gradient.@en

fraction collector
label: fraction collector@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: A fraction detector is a device that allows regular or specified samples to be taken from a column eluate and stored in a retrievable form. The storage vessels are usually small sample tubes or vials that are oriented in a rotating disk or in a moving belt, there movement usually being controlled by a microprocessor. On receiving a signal from the microprocessor, the next vial is placed under the column outlet and the eluate collected until receiving another signal from the computer. Once the properties of the chromatogram that describes the separation has been ascertained, then the collection program can be defined. The fractions can be collected on a basis of time either at regular intervals or a specific times to collect specific peaks. Alternatively the fractions can be collected by monitoring the detector output and when a peak starts to elute the fraction collector is activated and the peak collected in a specific vial. When the peak returns to base line the column eluate is then directed to waste until the next peak starts eluting. Fraction collectors are in common use with most liquid chromatographs. They are used to collect samples for further purification, subsequent examination by spectroscopic techniques or for biological or organoleptic testing.@en

Bruker Capillary LC-NMR platform
label: Bruker Capillary LC-NMR platform@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: Capillary LC-NMR is a hyphenated technique coupling capillary liquid chromatography and NMR, which increases sensitivity dramatically through the use of miniaturization of the chromatographic techniques and NMR detection volume. LC-NMR hyphenated systems separate a mixture into its pure components and couple the output to NMR for automatic sample analysis. The ever increasing need to measure lower sample amounts and lower level impurities demands the highest NMR sensitivity. Traditional LC-NMR systems with relatively large peak volumes are not optimized for such low levels of detection. Bruker BioSpin, together with Waters and Protasis has developed a Capillary LC-NMR system. The latest capillary LC attributes and highest capillary flow probe sensitivity combine with state of the art NMR systems technology. Greater mass sensitivity and faster spectral analysis with smaller sample volumes is possible. This system is ideal for analysis of metabolites and impurities associated with the drug development process.@en

electrical conductivity detector
label: electrical conductivity detector@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: The electrical conductivity detector measures the conductivity of the mobile phase. There is usually background conductivity which must be backed-off by suitable electronic adjustments. If the mobile phase contains buffers, the detector gives a base signal that completely overwhelms that from any solute usually making detection impossible. Thus, the electrical conductivity detector a bulk property detector. and senses all ions whether they are from a solute or from the mobile phase. In order to prevent polarization of the sensing electrodes, AC voltages must be used and so it is the impedance not the resistance of the electrode system that is actually measured. From a physical chemistry stand point the conductivity of a solution is more important than its resistance. However, it is the resistance (impedance) of the electrode system that determines the current across it. The resistance of any conductor varies directly as its length and inversely as its cross sectional area.@en

piston-seal

type: owl:Class
textual definition: The seal made by a piston in a diaphragm pump. The unique property of the reciprocating diaphragm pump is that the actuating piston does not come into direct contact with the mobile phase and thus, the demands on the piston-cylinder seal are not so great. The diaphragm has a relatively high surface area and thus, the movement of the diaphragm is relatively small and consequently the pump can be operated at a fairly high frequency. High frequency pumping results in a very significant reduction in pulse amplitude and, in addition, high frequency pulses are more readily damped by the column system. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that diaphragm pumps are not pulseless.@en

  Term depracted since the object property 'towards' used in the axioms is not avaliable in BFO2. 
editor note: This term represent a quality of molecular concentration. If there is need for some other sort of concentration - e.g. ratio of counts of cells, another term is needed. 

  OBI uses a standard unit for representing concentration qualities but this still needs to be decided on. A relation needs to be defined that relates the quality instance to the representation of its quantitative value in the chosen units. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration

  Measurements of concentration may be in any appropriate unit. Note that precise concentrations are virtually never known.

  Finally, note that there is no such thing as a concentration of 0. A concentration is a *relational* quality and so can't exist unless both entities it inheres in exist. However one map make concentration measurements that turn out not to be about concentrations qualities, if it happens that the scattered molecular aggregate doesn't actually exist.

The refractive index detector is one of the least sensitive LC detectors. It is very sensitive to changes in ambient temperature, pressure changes, flow-rate changes and can not be used for gradient elution. Despite these many disadvantages, this detector is extremely useful for detecting those compounds that are nonionic, do not adsorb in the UV, and do not fluoresce. There are many optical systems used in refractive index detectors but one of the most common is the differential refractive index detector.@en

flame photometric detector
label: flame photometric detector@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: The determination of sulfur or phosphorus containing compounds is the job of the flame photometric detector (FPD). This device uses the chemiluminescent reactions of these compounds in a hydrogen/air flame as a source of analytical information that is relatively specific for substances containing these two kinds of atoms. The emitting species for sulfur compounds is excited S2. The lambda max for emission of excited S2 is approximately 394 nm. The emitter for phosphorus compounds in the flame is excited HPO (lambda max = doublet 510-526 nm). In order to selectively detect one or the other family of compounds as it elutes from the GC column, an interference filter is used between the flame and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) to isolate the appropriate emission band. The drawback here being that the filter must be exchanged between chromatographic runs if the other family of compounds is to be detected.@en

pulsed amperometric detector
label: pulsed amperometric detector@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: A chromatography detector as used by high-performance anion exchange chromatography that provides sensitive and specific detection of carbohydrates. Pulsed Electrochemical Detection (PED) allows simple, sensitive, and direct detection of numerous polar aliphatic compounds, especially carbohydrates. This technique exploits the electrocatalytic activity of noble metal electrode surfaces to oxidize various polar functional groups. In PED, multi-step potential-time waveforms at Au and Pt electrodes realize amperometric/coulometric detection while maintaining uniform and reproducible electrode activity. The response mechanisms in PED are dominated by the surface properties of the electrode, and, as a consequence, members of each chemical class of compounds produce virtually identical voltammetric responses. Thus, the full potential is realized when combined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).@en

textual definition: Although there are many direct ozone chemiluminescent reactions with various gaseous molecules, the incorporation of a conversion step to convert various non-chemiluminescent analytes to a species capable of reacting with ozone to produce chemiluminescence broadens the horizon of this technique tremendously. The conversion of nearly all nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds to their respective chemiluminescent species for universal nitrogen and sulfur detection has made nitrogen/sulfur chemiluminescence detection the most widely used analytical methods based upon ozone-induced chemiluminescence. In addition to non-chromatographic applications, nitrogen/sulfur chemiluminescence detection has been adapted to various chromatographic techniques from gas chromatography to liquid and supercritical fluid chromatography as specialized element-specific detectors. The characteristics of these detectors are evaluated and compared to other element-selective detection techniques. The unique features of the chemiluminescence detectors have made them powerful tools in many diverse fields of analytical chemistry.@en

In radial columns the packing is supported between two cylindrical frits and the gap between represents the bed height or column length. The outer frit is the column inlet and consequently the sample initially has a large area of stationary phase with which to interact. Frits are porous metal products to prevent unwanted particles from entering the chromatography system. These particles may come from the sample, the solvent or debris generated by the chromatography system itself. Such particles entering the system may lead to clogging of capillaries, interference with the chromatography by changing chromatographic parameters or disturbance of the detector function. Characteristics of a frit, besides the diameter and the thickness, is the porosity (pore distribution, density).@en

chart recorder
label: chart recorder@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: The chart recorder is a device that transduces signal-intensities into a graphical peak output: As the separated components of the gas sample emerge into the detector, the change in voltage in the detecting bridge circuit causes a representative peak to be drawn on a chart recorder. The position of the peak along the time axis of the chart measures the component's retention time, which identifies the component. This is directly related to carrier gas flow rate, temperature and column packing and dimensions. The area under each peak is proportional to the concentration of the component of the sample. The area of the peaks inscribed on the chart recorder can be determined by multiplying the height of the peak in mm, by the width of the peak in mm at 1/2 the peak height. The calibration curves for use with the chart recorder are therefore peak area plotted against concentration.@en

high resolution magic angle spin probe

type: owl:Class
textual definition: Samples that are neither solid nor liquid, being of biological, chemical, or pharmaceutical interest, reveal highly resolved spectra when magic angle spinning is applied. The correct solution is a gradient, such that the field varies along the spinner axis. This so-called Magic Angle Gradient is employed in Brukers high resolution Magic Angle Spinning (hr-MAS) probes, and is implemented in such a way that it is compatible with the stator and does not interfere with the sample eject or insert. Bruker BioSpin has developed a series of dedicated probes for standard bore magnets to accommodate the rapidly expanding field of hr-MAS. These probes are available in double (e.g. 1H and 13C) and triple resonance (e.g. 1H, 13C, 15N) modes and come equipped with a deuterium lock channel. The probes have automatic sample ejection and insertion capability, with the availability of an optional sample changer, enabling fully automated sample runs. Probes can be equipped with an optional B0 gradient, directed along the magic angle, so that gradient spectroscopy can be done used.@en

The MATCH insert fits into a standard 10 mm Bruker spinner and is suitable for all non-spinning applications.\n   The MATCH system provides an easy and cost efficient means of optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio of each sample. By matching the NMR tube diameter to the size of the sample, most of the sample can be placed in the active column of the NMR coil. This leads to an enhanced signal detection compared to diluting the same sample quantity in a larger tube.@en

chromatography splitter
label: chromatography splitter@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: An adjustable restriction that is placed in the waste outlet to allow the necessary pressure to develop at the column inlet to force a flow (q ml/min) through the column. If the flow of mobile phase is Q ml/min then the waste flow will be (Q-q) ml/min. by adjusting the waste flow, the proportion of the sample entering the capillary column can be varied over a wide range of values and the necessary minimum permissible volume for the particular column in use can be selected for analysis. Unfortunately, the fraction taken in this way may not be representative of the original sample. This is due to the individual solutes in the mixture having different diffusivities and, thus, they distribute themselves across the sampling tube in an irregular manner. In general, the components with higher diffusivities (e.g., those solutes of lower molecular weight) will diffuse away from the bulk sample more quickly than those having lower diffusivities.@en

textual definition: Instead of measuring simple gas phase (carbon containing) ions created in a flame as with the flame ionization detector, or the change in background current because of electronegative element capture of thermal electrons as with the electron capture detector, the AED has a much wider applicability because it is based on the detection of atomic emissions. The strength of the AED lies in the detector's ability to simultaneously determine the atomic emissions of many of the elements in analytes that elute from a GC capillary column (called eluants or solutes in some books). As eluants come off the capillary column they are fed into a microwave powered plasma (or discharge) cavity where the compounds are destroyed and their atoms are excited by the energy of the plasma. The light that is emitted by the excited particles is separated into individual lines via a photodiode array. The associated computer then sorts out the individual emission lines and can produce chromatograms made up of peaks from eluants that contain only a specific element.@en

The fluidics subsystem flows the sequencing reagents across the wells of the PicoTiterPlate device, and moves the spent reagents from the PicoTiterPlate device to the waste receptacle. The optics subsystem consists of a CCD camera and a camera controller. The camera captures the light emitted in the wells of the PicoTiterPlate device during each step of the sequencing cycle, and sends the digital images to the computer subsystem for processing. The computer controls the other Sequencer subsystems, and processes the digital images sent by the camera to extract the DNA sequence information.

prothrombin time assay
label: prothrombin time assay
type: owl:Class
textual definition: The prothrombin time is an assay most commonly measured using blood plasma. Blood is drawn into a test tube containing liquid citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then centrifuged to separate blood cells from plasma. In newborns, whole blood is used. The plasma is analyzed by a biomedical scientist on an automated instrument at 37 degrees C, which takes a sample of the plasma. An excess of calcium is added (thereby reversing the effects of citrate), which enables the blood to clot again. For an accurate measurement the proportion of blood to citrate needs to be fixed; many laboratories will not perform the assay if the tube is underfilled and contains a relatively high concentration of citrate. If the tube is underfilled or overfilled with blood, the standardized dilution of 1 part anticoagulant to 9 parts whole blood is no longer valid. For the prothrombin time test the appropriate sample is the blue top tube, or sodium citrate tube, which is a liquid anticoagulant. Tissue factor (also known as factor III or thromboplastin) is added, and the time the sample takes to clot is measured optically. Some laboratories use a mechanical measurement, which eliminates interferences from lipemic and icteric samples. The prothrombin ratio is the prothrombin time for a patient, divided by the result for control plasma.
definition source: WEB:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time@2009/10/06

antithrombin-III (AT-III) berichrome assay
label: antithrombin-III (AT-III) berichrome assay
type: owl:Class
textual definition: An antithrombin-III (AT-III) assay in which exogenous bovine thrombin and heparin are added to test plasma to form a thrombin-heparin-AT complex. The residual thrombin not bound then hydrolyzes the p-nitroalanine substrate to produce a yellow color, which is read at 405 nm. The intensity of color produced is inversely proportional to the AT present. A calibration is done with standard human plasma reagent and results for a given specimen are reported as a percentage relative to the standard

spectrolyse heparin antifactor-Xa assay
label: spectrolyse heparin antifactor-Xa assay
type: owl:Class
textual definition: A Spectrolyse Heparin (Xa) assay is intended for the quantitative determination of therapeutic Heparin in human plasma.

  The principle inhibitor of Thrombin, Factor Xa and other coagulation serine proteases in plasma is Antithrombin III. The rate of inhibition, under normal conditions, is slow, but can be increased several thousand-fold by Heparin. This mechanism accounts for the anticoagulant effect of Heparin. Low Molecular Weight Therapeutic Heparin (LMWH) preparations appear to catalyze the reaction between Factor Xa and Antithrombin III more readily than the reaction between Thrombin and Antithrombin III while standard Heparin catalyzes both reactions equally. The Factor Xa inhibition test is the most useful test for assaying the widest variety of therapeutic Heparin preparations. In this method, when both Factor Xa and Antithrombin III are present in excess, the rate of Factor Xa inhibition is directly proportional to the Heparin concentration. The residual Factor Xa activity, measured with a Factor Xa-specific chromogenic substrate, is inversely proportional to the Heparin concentration.

textual definition: Southern blot analysis is a an assay used in molecular biology to assert the presence/absence status  of a specific DNA sequence in DNA samples. DNA samples to be assayed are first digested by restriction enzymes, fragments are then resolved by gel electrophoresis following by a blotting ensuring transfer to  nitrocellulose or nylon membrane. Immobilization of DNA fragments to the membrane is achieved by UV crosslinking and/or baking. Probes raised against the specific sequences are then hybridized to the membrane.  Detection of  hybridization signals is carried out by immunofluorescence or radioactivity measurements using photographic films or digital imaging devices such as Phosphor Imager.

editor note: 2012-12-17 JAO: In common lab usage, there is a distinction made between devices and reagents that is difficult to model. Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of "device", and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.

  2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:

  (1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.

  (2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.

  (3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.

  In the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay.

label: translation profiling design@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: A study design in which surface-bound, translationally competent ribosome complexes are used to generate a translation profile for mRNA, where mRNA may be a single molecular species, or a combination of species, including complex mixtures such as those found in the set of mRNAs isolated from a cell or tissue. One or more components of the surface-bound ribosome complex may be labeled at specific positions to permit analysis of multiple or single molecules for determination of ribosomal conformational changes and translation kinetics. Translation profiles are used as the basis for comparison of an mRNA or set of mRNA species. The translation profile can be used to determine such characteristics as kinetics of initiation, kinetic of elongation, identity of the polypeptide product, and the like. Analysis of translation profiles may be used to determine differential gene expression, optimization of mRNA sequences for expression, screening drug candidates for an effect on translation.@en

label: split-ubiquitin assay @en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: is a kind of yeast 2 hybrid system which enables membrane soluble proteins to be screened.  two integral membrane proteins to be studied are fused to two different ubiquitin moieties: a C-terminal ubiquitin moiety (\"Cub\", residues 35–76) and an N-terminal ubiquitin moiety (\"Nub\", residues 1–34). These fused proteins are called the bait and prey, respectively. In addition to being fused to an integral membrane protein, the Cub moiety is also fused to a transcription factor (TF) that can be cleaved off by ubiquitin specific proteases. Upon bait–prey interaction, Nub and Cub-moieties assemble, reconstituting the split-ubiquitin. The reconstituted split-ubiquitin molecule is recognized by ubiquitin specific proteases, which cleave off the reporter protein, allowing it to induce the transcription of reporter genes.@en

OBI:0001679
label: yeast 2-hybrid @en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: yeast 2 hybrid screen is an assay meant  to discover protein–protein interactions and protein–DNA interactions by testing for physical interactions (such as binding) between two proteins or a single protein and a DNA molecule, respectively. The premise behind the test is the activation of downstream reporter gene(s) by the binding of a transcription factor onto an upstream activating sequence (UAS). For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the binding domain (BD) and activating domain (AD). The BD is the domain responsible for binding to the UAS and the AD is the domain responsible for the activation of transcription.[1][2] The Y2H is thus a protein-fragment complementation assay.@en

label: bacterial one-hybrid @en
type: owl:Class
textual definition:  is a method for identifying the sequence-specific target site of a DNA-binding domain. In this system, a given transcription factor (TF) is expressed as a fusion to a subunit of RNA polymerase. In parallel, a library of randomized oligonucleotides representing potential TF target sequences, is cloned into a separate vector containing the selectable genes HIS3 and URA3. If the DNA-binding domain (bait) binds a potential DNA target site (prey) in vivo, it will recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter and activate transcription of the reporter genes in that clone. The two reporter genes, HIS3 and URA3, allow for positive and negative selections, respectively. At the end of the process, positive clones are sequenced and examined with motif-finding tools in order to resolve the favoured DNA target sequence@en

editor preferred term~editor preferred label: secondary cultured cell
has curation status: metadata complete
editor note: The term 'secondary cell culture' is generally used in biological texts/protocols to refer to any culture following an initial passage.  We include it here because there are often a number of passages between a primary culture and the establishment of a stable, homogenous cell line.  Such cultures are considered to be 'secondary cultures' but not 'cell lines' during this intermediate passaging/selection period between their derivation from a 'primary cell culture' and derivation into a 'cell line', which is a more specific type of secondary culture.
term editor: Person: Matthew Brush
comment: A secondary cultured cell has been passaged in culture or is a descendant of such a cell that is derived through propagation in culture.

establishing cell line
label: establishing cell line
type: owl:Class
textual definition: a process whereby a new type of cell line is created, either through passaging of a primary cell culture to relative genetic stability and compositional homogeneity, or through some experimental modification of an existing cell line to produce a new line with novel characteristics  (e.g. immortalization or some other stable genetic modification, or selection of some defined subset).

editor note: 2013-4-20 MHB: For cases of initial establilshment of a line from a primary culture, successive passaging and/or selection processes can confer increasing degrees of genetic stability and compositional homogeneity as compared to the input primary culture. Historically, many texts consider the first passage as the clearest point to define the beginning of a line. However, in practice it is more often that case that more than one passage, and possibly additional selective techniques, may be required before a culture is deemed to have sufficient stability and homogeneity to be considered cell line. This is the view taken in OBI. Regardless, what is important is that some intentional, experimental step has been taken to establish a more homogenous and stable culture that can be characterized and  progatated over time.

has curation status: requires discussion
editor note: MHB 3-22-13: Discussions are ongoing about the label of this class, given consideration of a second class that covers nucleic acid parts of cells or virions that participate in gene expression processes as a template for expression or a direct effector of expression of some other genetic element (e.g. an siRNA), but are not necessarily heritable by progeny or inherited from ancestors.  So things like transiently transfected plasmids and siRNAs would qualify as instances of this second class, but not of 'genetic material' as defined here.

  Also, OBI needs to import a class representing virions for an axiom on genetic material (part_of some (cell or virion).
comment: Naturally occurring or experimentally incorporated nucleic acids that meet these criteria can qualify as genetic/genomic material.

  Qualifying examples include: (1) inherited chromosomal DNA in germ cells, stem cells, fully differentiated cells, or cell line cells, or the DNA/RNA content of a virion; (2) natural replicons exchanged through horizontal gene transfer mechanisms such as bacterial conjugation, which are capable of replication and inheritance by progeny; (3) a chromosomally integrated  gene targeting DNA construct transfected into a cell; or (4) a stable extra-chromosomal replicon delivered into cells, such as a plasmid in bacterial host with ori allowing indefinite propagation.  

  Non-qualifying examples include a transiently transfected plasmid or siRNA oligo (as these are not able to be replicated and inherited by progeny cells).

editor note: 2013-6-5 MHB: Clarifications regarding the distinction between reagetns and devices were made at the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For examples, see editor note on OBI:device.
term editor: PERSON:Matthew Brush
comment: (copied from ReO)
  Reagents are distinguished from devices/instruments that also serve as facilitators in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in or have parts that participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during their intended participation in some technique.  By contrast, devices do not participate in a chemical reaction/interaction during the technique.

  Reagents are distinguished from study subjects/evaluants in that study subjects and evaluants are that about which conclusions are drawn and knowledge is sought in an investigation - while reagents, by definition, are not.  It should be noted, however, that reagent and study subject/evaluant roles can be borne by instances of the same type of material entity - but a given instance can only realize one of these roles in the execution of a given  assay. For example, taq polymerase can bear a reagent role or an evaluant role.  In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized. In an assay to evaluate the quality of the taq polymerase itself, the evaluant/study subject role of the taq is realized, but not the reagent role since the taq is the subject about which data is generated.

  In regard to the statement that reagents are 'distinct' from the specified outputs of a technique:  note that a reagent may be incorporated into a material output of a technique, as long as the IDENTITY of this output is distinct from that of the bearer of the reagent role.  For example, dNTPs input into a PCR are reagents that become part of the material output of this technique, but this output has a new identity (ie that of a 'nucleic acid molecule') that is distinct from the identity of the dNTPs that comprise it.  Similarly, a biotin molecule input into a cell labeling technique are reagents that become part of the specified output, but the identity of the output is that of some modified cell specimen which shares identity with the input unmodified cell specimen, and not with the biotin label. Thus, we see that an important criteria of 'reagent-ness' is that it is a facilitator, and not the primary focus of an investigation or material processing technique (ie not the specified subject/evaluant about which knowledge is sought, or the specified output material of the technique).

editor note: The term 'secondary cell culture' is generally used in biological texts/protocols to refer to any culture of cells following an initial passage.  We include it here because there are often a number of passages between a primary culture and the establishment of a stable, homogenous cell line.  Such cultures are considered to be 'secondary cultures' but not 'cell lines' during this intermediate passaging/selection period between their derivation from a 'primary cell culture' and derivation into a 'cell line', which is a more specific type of secondary culture.
term editor: PERSON:Matthew Brush
comment: The concept of a 'secondary cultured cell population' covers cell lines as well as cultured cell populations more immediately derived from a primary culture which have yet to achieve adequate genetic stability and compositional homogeneity to be considered a cell line. The extent of the collection of cells in a 'secondary cultured cell population' is restricted only in that all cell members must share a propagation history (ie be derived through a common lineage of passages from an initial culture).  Secondary cultured cell populations can be under active culture, stored in a quiescent state for future use, or applied experimentally.

Two analyses were used for the selection of reference genes: direct comparison of susceptible, Trincadeira, and resistant, Regent, V. vinifera cultivars at 0 h, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours post inoculation with P. viticola (genotype effect); and comparison of each genotype with mock inoculated samples during inoculation time-course (biotic stress effect).

editor note: 10/20/09: This class and all subclasses are currently problematic. They should all be imported from other OBO foundry ontologies. (FMA / CARO / UBERON).

Currently we will use anatomical entities as if they are valid across species.@en
editor note: 13-02-2009:
  Biomaterial branch: change of label and definition following discussions at the OBI winter meeting 2009. It was felt that 'macroscopic part of multicellular organism' introduce an impractical delineation.

  IMPORTANT NOTE:  OBI 'anatomical entity' would essentially correspond to FMA 'material anatomical entity' rather than FMA 'physical anatomical entity'. OBI does not include 'immaterial anatomical entity' as it would clash with the parent class 'material entity'

  DOCUMENTATION NOTE: OBI anatomical entity granularity level excludes cell and biological  molecules.

comment: The extent of a 'cultured cell population' is restricted only in that all cell members must share a propagation history (ie be derived through a common lineage of passages from an initial culture). In being defined in this way, this class can be used to refer to the populations that researchers actually use in the practice of science - ie are the inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The cells in such populations will be a relatively uniform population as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. And this population will also have a single passage number, again owing to their common passaging history. Cultured cell populations represent only a collection of cells (ie do not include media, culture dishes, etc), and include populations of cultured unicellular organisms or cultured multicellular organism cells. They can exist under active culture, stored in a quiescent state for future use, or applied experimentally.

  Note that common usage in the literature is often of the form \"a human colorectal cancer cell line\", as seen above. But such references to studies in \"a line\" refer to the fact that discrete populations of cells that are input into culturing or experiments, not an entire lineage of cells.  It is these discrete populations that we refer to as 'cell lines'.

editor note: 2013-08-09 MHB: Replaced with cell line class from CLO, follwoing outcome of Spring 2013 CLO alignment work.  Subclass axioms were: 'has grain' some 'cell line cell' and 'has grain' only 'cell line cell'

  2013-6-5 MHB: There is considerable ambiguity and inconsistent usage surrounding the term 'cell line' across biomedical communities. For exmaple, it can refer to the maximal collection of all cells in a cultured lineage (e.g. the colelction of all HeLa cells that exist), or to discrete portions of this maximal collection that are stored, exchanged, and applied experimentally (e.g. the dish of HeLa cells I am using in my experiment). A working group of representatives from OBI, CLO, and CL was assembled in spring of 2013 to harmonize modeling and terminology surrounding experimentally cultured cells across Open Biomedical Ontologies, following OBO Foundry principles of orthogonality and re-use. A consensus was reached to apply the term 'cell line' to refer not to a maximal collection of cells of a given type, but to discrete populations of cultured cells that share a common propagation history which has conferred a certain a genetic stability and compositional homogeneity to the population.  This meaning reflects its most common usage in domain discourse, and will best support data annotation requirements. This view means that a 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this specific history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to collections such as all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as all cells in these collections do not necessarily share a common culture history. Rather, it could be used to refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).

  This approach seems to accomplish several desirable goals:
  1) It allows us to define the term 'cell line' for the community in a precise way that also reflects how the term is most commonly used in the literature and scientific discourse.
  (2) It gives a definition that provides clear criteria to help specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world
  (3) The criteria it provides demarcate populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - ie are the inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The cells in such populations will be a relatively uniform population as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. And this population will also have a single passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.
  (4) The definition seems to be true to the meaning of the word 'line' - which is suggests a specific lineage of derivation.

comment: 1. The term 'line' is used when a culture has undergone an intentional experimental process to establish a more uniform and stable population of cells (see 'establishing cell line'). This will require one or more passages, but may involve additional selection processes. Through such passaging and/or selection processes, the resulting 'line' attains some level of genetic stability and compositional homogeneity which is typically absent in primary cultures. Because of their relative homogeneity, 'lines' are capable of being characterized and stably propagated over a period of time. A *new* cell line can be "established" not only through the passaging/selection of a primary culture, but also through experimental modifications of existing lines (e.g. immortalization, stable genetic modifications, drug selection for a resistant subset, etc.).  As defined here,  'cell line' can refer to a population of cells in active culture, applied experimentally, or stored in a quescent state for future use. 

  2. The definitional criteria provided here for the 'cell line' class demarcates populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - e.g. as inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The definition is such that cell lines will exhibit important attributes. For example, they will have a relatively homogenous cell type composition as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. In addition, these populations can also be characterized by a passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.?

  3. Definitinal criteria are intended to be sufficiently clear to specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world. A 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this common history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to the collection of all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as cells in these collections will likely not all share a common culture history. Rather, 'HeLa cell line' could refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).  As noted above, it is such collections that are typically referred to in scientific discourse and publications.

  4. Notably, the term 'line' has been alternately used by other terminologies and communities to refer to cultures that have been immortalized - ie has attained the capacity for indefinite propagation in vitro.  In this ontology, we refer to such cell lines as 'immortal cell lines', and use the term 'cell line' to indicate any culture that has been passaged.

K-fold cross validation method
label: K-fold cross validation method@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: K-fold cross-validation randomly partitions the original sample into K subsamples. Of the K subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining K - 1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated K times (the folds), with each of the K subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The K results from the folds then can be averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method over repeated random sub-sampling is that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once. 10-fold cross-validation is commonly used

definition source: Bootstrapping is a data transformation process which estimates the precision of sampling statistics by drawing randomly with replacement from a set of data points
example of usage: Although widely accepted that high throughput biological data are typically highly noisy, the effects that this uncertainty has upon the conclusions we draw from these data are often overlooked. However, in order to assign any degree of confidence to our conclusions, we must quantify these effects. Bootstrap resampling is one method by which this may be achieved.

type: owl:Class
textual definition: A k-means clustering is a data transformation which achieves a class discovery or partitioning objective, which takes as input a collection of objects (represented as points in multidimensional space) and which partitions them into a specified number k of clusters. The algorithm attempts to find the centers of natural clusters in the data. The most common form of the algorithm starts by partitioning the input points into k initial sets, either at random or using some heuristic data. It then calculates the mean point, or centroid, of each set. It constructs a new partition by associating each point with the closest centroid. Then the centroids are recalculated for the new clusters, and the algorithm repeated by alternate applications of these two steps until convergence, which is obtained when the points no longer switch clusters (or alternatively centroids are no longer changed).@en

loess fitting
label: loess fitting@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: A loess fitting is a curve fitting obtained by localized regression. The latter refers to fitting a polynomial (straight line, quadratic, cubic, etc) to data values within a window covering a fraction of the total number of observations. As the window slides along the axis, a new polynomial is fit to the observations falling within the window. This continues until all points are fit with a local polynomial. The results are then smoothed together to form a curve. The smoothness of loess fits is controlled by a smoothing parameter (often denoted as alpha, usually between 1/4 and 1) and the degree of the polynomial that is fitted by the method (usually denoted by lambda).@en

arc lamp
label: arc lamp@en
type: owl:Class
textual definition: Arc lamp is a light source that produces light by an electric arc (or voltaic arc). The lamp consists of two electrodes typically made of tungsten which are separated by a gas. The type of lamp is often named by the gas contained in the bulb; including neon, argon, xenon, krypton, sodium, metal halide, and mercury. The electric arc in an arc lamp consists of gas which is initially ionized by a voltage and is therefore electrically conductive. To start an arc lamp, usually a very high voltage is needed to ignite or strike the arc. This requires an electrical circuit sometimes called an igniter, which is part of a larger circuit called the ballast. The ballast supplies a suitable voltage and current to the lamp as its electrical characteristics change with temperature and time. Older cytometers may use arc lamps to irradiate particles at the interrogation point.@en

We aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying FFA-induced insulin resistance in patients with HIV-lipodystrophy. Research Design and Methods: Using a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design, we studied the effects of an overnight acipimox-induced suppression of FFA on glucose and FFA metabolism by using stable isotope labelled tracer techniques during basal conditions and a two-stage euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp (20 mU insulin/m(2)/min; 50 mU insulin/m(2)/min) in nine patients with nondiabetic HIV-lipodystrophy. All patients received antiretroviral therapy. Biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained during each stage of the clamp. Results: Acipimox treatment reduced basal FFA rate of appearance by 68.9% (52.6%-79.5%) and decreased plasma FFA concentration by 51.6 % (42.0%-58.9%), (both, P < 0.0001). Endogenous glucose production was not influenced by acipimox. During the clamp the increase in glucose-uptake was significantly greater after acipimox treatment compared to placebo (acipimox: 26.85 (18.09-39.86) vs placebo: 20.30 (13.67-30.13) mumol/kg/min; P < 0.01). Insulin increased phosphorylation of Akt (Thr(308)) and GSK-3beta (Ser(9)), decreased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (GS) site 3a+b and increased GS-activity (I-form) in skeletal muscle (P < 0.01). Acipimox decreased phosphorylation of GS (site 3a+b) (P < 0.02) and increased GS-activity (P < 0.01) in muscle. Conclusion: The present study provides direct evidence that suppression of lipolysis in patients with HIV-lipodystrophy improves insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose-uptake. The increased glucose-uptake may in part be explained by increased dephosphorylation of GS (site 3a+b) resulting in increased GS activity.@en

example of usage: PMID: 17288613-BSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Physicians in Canadian emergency departments (EDs) annually treat 185,000 alert and stable trauma victims who are at risk for cervical spine (C-spine) injury. However, only 0.9% of these patients have suffered a cervical spine fracture. Current use of radiography is not efficient. The Canadian C-Spine Rule is designed to allow physicians to be more selective and accurate in ordering C-spine radiography, and to rapidly clear the C-spine without the need for radiography in many patients. The goal of this phase III study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an active strategy to implement the Canadian C-Spine Rule into physician practice. Specific objectives are to: 1) determine clinical impact, 2) determine sustainability, 3) evaluate performance, and 4) conduct an economic evaluation. METHODS: We propose a matched-pair cluster design study that compares outcomes during three consecutive 12-months before, after, and decay periods at six pairs of intervention and control sites. These 12 hospital ED sites will be stratified as teaching or community hospitals, matched according to baseline C-spine radiography ordering rates, and then allocated within each pair to either intervention or control groups. During the after period at the intervention sites, simple and inexpensive strategies will be employed to actively implement the Canadian C-Spine Rule. The following outcomes will be assessed: 1) measures of clinical impact, 2) performance of the Canadian C-Spine Rule, and 3) economic measures. During the 12-month decay period, implementation strategies will continue, allowing us to evaluate the sustainability of the effect. We estimate a sample size of 4,800 patients in each period in order to have adequate power to evaluate the main outcomes. DISCUSSION: Phase I successfully derived the Canadian C-Spine Rule and phase II confirmed the accuracy and safety of the rule, hence, the potential for physicians to improve care. What remains unknown is the actual change in clinical behaviors that can be affected by implementation of the Canadian C-Spine Rule, and whether implementation can be achieved with simple and inexpensive measures. We believe that the Canadian C-Spine Rule has the potential to significantly reduce health care costs and improve the efficiency of patient flow in busy Canadian EDs.@en

Presently, vitreous tamponades such as gas or silicone oil cannot contact the lower part of the retina. A heavier-than-water tamponade displaces the inflammatory and PVR-stimulating environment from the inferior area of the retina. The Heavy Silicone Oil versus Standard Silicone Oil Study (HSO Study) is designed to answer the question of whether a heavier-than-water tamponade improves the prognosis of eyes with PVR of the lower retina. Methods: The HSO Study is a multicentre, randomized, prospective controlled clinical trial comparing two endotamponades within a two-arm parallel group design. Patients with inferiorly and posteriorly located PVR are randomized to either heavy silicone oil or standard silicone oil as a tamponading agent. Three hundred and fifty consecutive patients are recruited per group. After intraoperative re-attachment, patients are randomized to either standard silicone oil (1000 cSt or 5000 cSt) or Densiron((R)) as a tamponading agent. The main endpoint criteria are complete retinal attachment at 12 months and change of visual acuity (VA) 12 months postoperatively compared with the preoperative VA. Secondary endpoints include complete retinal attachment before endotamponade removal, quality of life analysis and the number of retina affecting re-operation within 1 year of follow-up. Results: The design and early recruitment phase of the study are described. Conclusions: The results of this study will uncover whether or not heavy silicone oil improves the prognosis of eyes with PVR.@en

The number of units per block equals the number of treatment so each block receives each treatment exactly once (hence the qualifier 'complete'). The design was originally devised from field trials used in agronomy and agriculture. The analysis assumes that there is no interaction between block and treatment. The method was then used in other settings So The randomised complete block design is a design in which the subjects are matched according to a variable which the experimenter wishes to control. The subjects are put into groups (blocks) of the same size as the number of treatments. The members of each block are then randomly assigned to different treatment groups.@en

Linear increases with DCAD occurred in DM intake, milk fat percentage, 4% fat-corrected milk production, milk true protein, milk lactose, and milk solids-not-fat. Milk production itself was unaffected by DCAD. Jugular venous blood pH, base excess and HCO3(-) concentration, and urine pH increased, but jugular venous blood Cl- concentration, urine titratable acidity, and net acid excretion decreased linearly with increasing DCAD. An elevated ratio of coccygeal venous plasma essential AA to nonessential AA with increasing DCAD indicated that N metabolism in the rumen was affected, probably resulting in more microbial protein flowing to the small intestine. Cows fed 16% CP had lower urea N in milk than cows fed 19% CP; the same was true for urea N in coccygeal venous plasma and urine. Dry matter intake, milk production, milk composition, and acid-base status did not differ between the 16 and 19% CP treatments. It was concluded that DCAD affected DM intake and performance of dairy cows in early lactation.

Using the same food intake data and the expanded National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute food composition data base, these analyses of sources of variance have been expanded to include classes of carbohydrate, vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, iron, total ash, caffeine, and crude fiber. The analyses relate to observed intakes (replicated six times) of 30 adult males and 30 adult females obtained under a paired Graeco-Latin square design with sequence of interview, interviewer, and day of the week as determinants. Neither sequence nor interviewer made consistent contribution to variance. In females, day of the week had a significant effect for several nutrients. The major partitioning of variance was between interindividual variation (between subjects) and intraindividual variation (within subjects) which included both true day-to-day variation in intake and methodological variation. For all except caffeine, the intraindividual variability of 1-day data was larger than the interindividual variability. For vitamin A, almost all of the variance was associated with day-to-day variability. One day data provide a very inadequate estimate of usual intake of individuals. In the design of nutrition studies it is critical that the intended use of dietary data be a major consideration in deciding on methodology. There is no ideal dietary method. There may be preferred methods for particular purposes.@en

The advantages of factorial designs over one-factor-at-a-time experiments is that they are more efficient and they allow interactions to be detected. In statistics, a factorial design experiment is an experiment whose design consists of two or more factors, each with discrete possible values or levels, and whose experimental units take on all possible combinations of these levels across all such factors. Such an experiment allows studying the effect of each factor on the response variable, as well as the effects of interactions between factors on the response variable.@en

Four groups of rats were arranged in a 2x2 factorial design with 2 levels of Social procedure (Intermittent Social vs Continuous Social) and 2 levels of sipper Liquid (Ethanol vs Water). Intermittent Social groups received 35 trials per session. Each trial consisted of the insertion of the sipper tube for 10 s followed by lifting of the guillotine door for 15 s. The guillotine door separated the experimental rat from the conspecific rat in the wire mesh cage during the 60 s inter-trial interval. The Continuous Social groups received similar procedures except that the guillotine door was raised during the entire duration of the session. For the Ethanol groups, the concentrations of ethanol in the sipper [3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16% (vol/vol)] increased across sessions, while the Water groups received 0% ethanol (water) in the sipper throughout the experiment. Both Social procedures induced more intake of ethanol than water. The Intermittent Social procedure induced more ethanol intake at the two highest ethanol concentration blocks (10-12% and 14-16%) than the Continuous Social procedure, but this effect was not observed with water.

They belong to the new genomics technologies which have important applications in the biological, agricultural and pharmaceutical sciences. There are myriad sources of uncertainty in microarray experiments, and rigorous experimental design is essential for fully realizing the potential of these valuable resources. Two questions frequently asked by biologists on the brink of conducting cDNA or two-colour, spotted microarray experiments are 'Which mRNA samples should be competitively hybridized together on the same slide?' and 'How many times should each slide be replicated?' Early experience has shown that whilst the field of classical experimental design has much to offer this emerging multi-disciplinary area, new approaches which accommodate features specific to the microarray context are needed. In this paper, we propose optimal designs for factorial and time course experiments, which are special designs arising quite frequently in microarray experimentation. Our criterion for optimality is statistical efficiency based on a new notion of admissible designs; our approach enables efficient designs to be selected subject to the information available on the effects of most interest to biologists, the number of arrays available for the experiment, and other resource or practical constraints, including limitations on the amount of mRNA probe. We show that our designs are superior to both the popular reference designs, which are highly inefficient, and to designs incorporating all possible direct pairwise comparisons. Moreover, our proposed designs represent a substantial practical improvement over classical experimental designs which work in terms of standard interactions and main effects. The latter do not provide a basis for meaningful inference on the effects of most interest to biologists, nor make the most efficient use of valuable and limited resources.@en

METHODOLOGY: 65 treatment-naove CHC patients who finished a 24-week therapy with peginterferon (alpha-2b (1.5 mcg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (1000-1200 mg /day) and 24 weeks of follow-up were enrolled. Hepatic fibrosis was graded by the METAVIR scoring system. Serum quantitative HCV RNA was determined by Versant HCV RNA 3.0 assay (Bayer Inc.). RESULTS: Genotype non-1 patients responded quickly and a higher percentage of them achieved undetectable HCV RNA (< 615 IU/mL) at week 4 compared with genotype 1 patients (93% vs. 69%, p = 0.018). Degree of hepatic fibrosis significantly affected end-of-treatment and sustained response (SVR). For patients who did not achieve early virological response (EVR), the negative predictive value for SVR was 100%. In genotype 1 patients, undetectable HCV RNA by week 4 was a good marker to predict treatment response, with a positive predictive value of 84% and a negative predictive value of 82%. CONCLUSIONS: EVR can be applied to Chinese patients as an early stopping rule. A 24-week duration of pegylated IFN/ribavirin might be adequate for genotype 1 patients who rapidly responded to therapy.@en

comment: A 'cell culture' as used here referes to a new lineage of cells in culture deriving from a single biological source.. New cultures are established through the initial isolation and culturing of cells from an organismal source, or through changes in an existing cell culture or line that result in a new culture with unique characteristics.  This can occur through the passaging/selection of a primary culture into a secondary culture or line, or experimental modifications of an existing cell culture or line such as an immortalization process or other stable genetic modification. This class covers establishment of cultures of either multicellular organism cells or unicellular organisms.

comment: An active cell culture is typically split when it has grown to confluence in its culture dish.  Cell culture splitting of a cell culture sample results in an increase in its passage number, which measures how long a sample has been propagated in vitro, and therefore how many selective or genetic changes it is likely to have undergone.

bound_to
label: bound_to
type: owl:ObjectProperty
textual definition: A relationship between two material entities that form a complex based on a selective, non-covalent interaction.
editor preferred term~editor preferred label: bound_to
editor note: The definition of this term is modeled after the Chebi:50967 and GO:0005488 terms. Further alignment of the logical definitions with those ontologies will require agreement on the placement of GO:molecular function in BFO among other things. OBI will retire this term once such an alignment is achieved as 'bound to' is not in the primary OBI scope.
